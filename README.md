*Thank you for visiting my Bitbucket :+1:* 

I am working on a personal project based on a very cool idea - *as I think :)* - and here is a part of it.

It is a beta version and I am still working on it in order to enhance my JS Backend skills.

The stack I am using is MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node). *The Angular concerns the Frontend* 

### What is this repository for? ###
This repository represent the backend side of my personal project and it shows some of my skills in JavaScript

It contains a REST API, enabling : **sign-up, sign-in, email verification, reset password, access user profil**. These functionalities are based on JSON Web Token JWT. This Api is based on Node ecosystem and its modules.

### What modules are used ? ###
**express**, **mongoose**, **cors**, **body-parser**, **jsonwebtoken**, **path**, **morgan**, **bcrypt** and **others** 


### How do I get set up? ###

If you would like to you test it you just need to :

1. Download this repository.
1. Run **npm install** to install the necessary modules.
1. Create (in the root folder) the **config.js** file and fill it with the necessary variables (SECRET_EMAIL, SECRET, DATABASE).
1. Run the **node server.js** .
1. ENJOY :+1:
